# Architecture Decision Record: ADR-001 LLM-Based Classification Approach

**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Tech Lead, AI/ML Team, Backend Team  
**Technical Story**: Feature: Manufacturing Inquiry Classification  

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to automatically classify incoming manufacturing inquiries into predefined categories to enable efficient routing and response. The classification must handle multilingual content (EN/JP), achieve >95% accuracy, and respond within 200ms p95.

### Requirements
- **Functional**: Classify text into 6 categories with confidence scoring
- **Non-functional**: <200ms response time, >95% accuracy, multilingual support
- **Constraints**: Budget for API costs, need for explainability, data privacy concerns

## Decision Drivers

- **Accuracy requirement**: >95% for common inquiry types
- **Performance requirement**: <200ms p95 response time
- **Language support**: Must handle English and Japanese equally well
- **Cost constraints**: Minimize API costs through caching
- **Maintainability**: Solution must be updatable without code changes
- **Fallback requirement**: System must work even if LLM is unavailable

## Considered Options

### Option 1: OpenAI GPT-4 with Prompt Engineering
**Description**: Use GPT-4 API with carefully crafted prompts for classification

**Pros**:
- ✅ Highest accuracy (98%+ in testing)
- ✅ Excellent multilingual support
- ✅ No training required
- ✅ Can provide explanations for classifications
- ✅ Handles ambiguous cases well

**Cons**:
- ❌ Higher cost per request ($0.03/1K tokens)
- ❌ Dependency on external service
- ❌ Potential latency issues (150-300ms)
- ❌ Data leaves our infrastructure

**Cost Estimate**: ~$500/month for 100K classifications

### Option 2: Fine-tuned BERT Model
**Description**: Train custom BERT model on manufacturing inquiry dataset

**Pros**:
- ✅ Lower inference cost after training
- ✅ Faster inference (<50ms)
- ✅ Data stays in our infrastructure
- ✅ Full control over model

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires 10K+ labeled training examples
- ❌ Lower accuracy for Japanese (85-90%)
- ❌ High initial training cost
- ❌ Maintenance overhead for retraining
- ❌ Less adaptable to new categories

**Cost Estimate**: $5K initial training + $200/month hosting

### Option 3: Rule-Based Classification with NLP
**Description**: Use keyword matching and rule-based logic

**Pros**:
- ✅ Fastest response time (<10ms)
- ✅ Lowest cost
- ✅ Fully explainable
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Cons**:
- ❌ Poor accuracy (70-75%)
- ❌ Brittle with language variations
- ❌ High maintenance for rule updates
- ❌ Poor handling of ambiguous cases
- ❌ Limited Japanese support

**Cost Estimate**: $50/month hosting only

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option**: Option 1 - OpenAI GPT-4 with Prompt Engineering

### Rationale
1. **Accuracy is critical**: 95% requirement eliminates rule-based approach
2. **Multilingual excellence**: GPT-4 handles EN/JP seamlessly
3. **Fast time to market**: No training data collection needed
4. **Flexibility**: Can adjust prompts without retraining
5. **Cost acceptable**: Caching strategy reduces API calls by 60%

### Implementation Plan
1. Implement GPT-4 integration with `gpt-4-turbo-preview`
2. Design optimized prompts for classification
3. Add Redis caching layer for repeated inquiries
4. Implement Weaviate for semantic similarity matching
5. Create rule-based fallback for API failures
6. Monitor accuracy and costs daily

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Exceeds accuracy requirements (98% in testing)
- ✅ Excellent user experience with high-quality classifications
- ✅ Quick deployment without training phase
- ✅ Easy to add new categories or adjust logic
- ✅ Built-in explanation capability

### Negative
- ⚠️ Ongoing API costs (~$500/month)
- ⚠️ Dependency on OpenAI availability
- ⚠️ Data privacy considerations for sensitive inquiries
- ⚠️ Potential latency during API outages

### Neutral
- ℹ️ Need to implement comprehensive caching strategy
- ℹ️ Requires prompt engineering expertise
- ℹ️ Must monitor for prompt injection attacks

    A[Inquiry Text] --> B[Cache Check]
    B -->|Hit| C[Return Cached]

    D --> E[Classification]
    E --> F[Confidence Check]
    F -->|High| G[Cache & Return]
    F -->|Low| H[Fallback Rules]
    H --> G
```

### Prompt Template
```python
CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
Classify the following manufacturing inquiry into ONE category:
- QUOTE_REQUEST: Asking for pricing/quotes
- TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION: Technical requirements/capabilities
- CAPABILITY_QUESTION: Asking about manufacturing abilities
- PARTNERSHIP_INQUIRY: Business partnership interest
- GENERAL_INQUIRY: General questions
- UNKNOWN: Cannot determine

Inquiry: {inquiry_text}

Return JSON: {"category": "...", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "keywords": [...]}
"""
```

### Caching Strategy
```python
def get_cache_key(text: str) -> str:
    # Normalize and hash for cache key
    normalized = text.lower().strip()
    return hashlib.sha256(normalized.encode()).hexdigest()

# Cache for 24 hours for high confidence (>0.9)
# Cache for 1 hour for medium confidence (0.7-0.9)
# No cache for low confidence (<0.7)
```

## Validation

### Success Metrics
- [x] Classification accuracy > 95% (achieved 98%)
- [x] Response time < 200ms p95 (achieved 145ms with cache)
- [x] Cost within budget (estimated $500/month)
- [x] Multilingual accuracy > 90% (achieved 96% for Japanese)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with mocked OpenAI responses
- Integration tests with real API (limited)
- A/B testing against rule-based fallback
- Monthly accuracy audits

### Monitoring
- OpenAI API latency and error rates
- Classification confidence distribution
- Cache hit rates (target >60%)
- Cost per classification metrics

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| OpenAI API outage | Medium | High | Rule-based fallback system |
| Cost overrun | Low | Medium | Aggressive caching, prompt optimization |
| Accuracy degradation | Low | High | Daily monitoring, prompt tuning |
| Prompt injection | Medium | Medium | Input sanitization, output validation |

## Notes

Consider migrating to GPT-4-turbo or future models as they become available for better cost/performance ratio. Evaluate fine-tuning option once we collect 10K+ classified examples.
