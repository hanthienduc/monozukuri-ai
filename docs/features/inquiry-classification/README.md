# Feature: Manufacturing Inquiry Classification

## 📋 Feature Overview

**Status**: 📝 Documentation  
**Priority**: 🔴 High  
**Sprint**: Sprint 1 - Core Features  
**Owner**: AI/ML Team & Backend Team  
**Created**: 2025-08-13  
**Target Completion**: 2025-08-20  

### Summary
An intelligent API endpoint that automatically classifies incoming manufacturing inquiries into predefined categories (Quote Request, Technical Specification, Capability Question, Partnership Inquiry) using LLM-based classification with confidence scoring. This enables automatic routing, prioritization, and response generation for manufacturing inquiries.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Manual classification of inquiries is time-consuming and inconsistent
- **Solution**: AI-powered automatic classification with 95%+ accuracy
- **Impact**: Reduce response time by 50%, improve routing accuracy
- **Success Metrics**: Classification accuracy > 95%, Response time < 200ms, User satisfaction > 4.5/5

- [ ] Extract key terms/entities from inquiry text
- [ ] Support metadata enrichment (source, customer_id, priority)
- [ ] Maintain audit log of classifications for ML training
- [ ] Handle rate limiting (100 requests/minute per client)
- [ ] Implement fallback classification for model failures

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: < 200ms p95 response time

  id: string;                        // UUID
  text: string;                      // Original inquiry text
  language: 'en' | 'ja' | 'other';   // Detected language
  classification: {
    primary_category: CategoryType;
    confidence: number;
    all_categories: CategoryScore[];
    model_version: string;
  };
  metadata: {
    source: 'web_form' | 'email' | 'chat' | 'api';
    customer_id?: string;
    processed_at: Timestamp;
    processing_time_ms: number;
  };
  embeddings?: number[];             // Cached text embeddings
  keywords?: string[];               // Extracted keywords
  suggested_actions?: string[];      // Routing suggestions
  created_at: Timestamp;

// Firestore Composite Indexes Required:
// 1. classification.primary_category + created_at DESC
// 2. metadata.customer_id + created_at DESC
// 3. language + classification.primary_category

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Mockups
- [Link to Figma/design tool]
- [Screenshots if available]

### User Flow
1. Customer submits inquiry via web form/email/API
2. System receives and validates inquiry text
3. Classification service processes inquiry:
   - Detects language
   - Extracts key terms
   - Classifies into categories
   - Calculates confidence scores
4. System routes inquiry based on classification:
   - QUOTE_REQUEST → Sales team queue
   - TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION → Engineering review
   - CAPABILITY_QUESTION → Support team
   - PARTNERSHIP_INQUIRY → Business development
5. Assigned team receives notification with context
6. System logs classification for ML training
