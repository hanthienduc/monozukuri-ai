```

### Code Example
```python
# Example implementation pattern
class ServiceImplementation:
    def __init__(self, db, cache):
        self.db = db
        self.cache = cache
    
    async def process(self, request):
        # Implementation following the decision
        pass
```

### Configuration
```yaml
# Example configuration
service:
  option: chosen_value
  performance:
    timeout: 30s
    max_connections: 100
```

## Validation

### Success Metrics
- [ ] [Metric 1: e.g., Response time < 200ms p95]
- [ ] [Metric 2: e.g., Error rate < 1%]
- [ ] [Metric 3: e.g., Cost within budget]

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: [Coverage requirements]
- **Integration Tests**: [What to validate]
- **Performance Tests**: [Load requirements]
- **Security Tests**: [Security validations]

### Monitoring
- [What metrics to track]
- [Alert thresholds]
- [Dashboard requirements]
